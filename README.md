This program compares different ways of sorting an array in Java to find oud which is the fastest.

## bubble sort
Bubble sort is one way to sort an array of values.
It compares each item to the item that follows the item.
If the objects are not in the correct order, they are swapped so that the largest of the two moves up. This process continues until the largest of the objects, eventually "bubbles" up to the highest position in the array.

After this occurs, the search for the next largest object begins. The swapping continues until the whole array is in the correct order.
